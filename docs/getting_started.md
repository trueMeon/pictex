# Getting Started

Welcome to PicTex! This guide will get you from installation to your first composed image in just a few minutes.

## The Core Idea: Composing Builders

The core idea of PicTex is to build complex visuals by **composing simple builders**.

1.  **Builders**: These are the fundamental building blocks of your image. You have content builders like `Text` and `Image`, and layout builders like `Row` and `Column` to arrange them.

2.  **`Canvas`**: This is the top-level container for your entire image. You can use it to set global styles (like a default font or a background color) and to kick off the final render.

The workflow is simple: you create and nest builders to form a tree structure representing your visual, and then you tell the `Canvas` to render it.

### Quickstart: Creating a User Banner

Let's build a simple user banner to see these concepts in action.

```python
from pictex import Canvas, Row, Column, Text, Image

# 1. Create the individual content builders
avatar = (
    Image("avatar.jpg")
    .size(60, 60)
    .border_radius('50%') # Make it circular
)

user_info = Column(
    Text("Alex Doe").font_size(20).font_weight(700),
    Text("@alexdoe").color("#657786")
).gap(4) # Add a 4px vertical gap between the texts

# 2. Compose the builders in a layout container
user_banner = Row(
    avatar,
    user_info
).gap(15).align_items('center')  # Vertically center the avatar and user info

# 3. Create a Canvas and render the final composition
canvas = Canvas().padding(20).background_color("#F5F8FA")
image = canvas.render(user_banner)

# 4. Save the result
image.save("user_banner.png")
```

This example shows the power of composition: an `Image` and a `Column` are nested inside a `Row` to create a clean, aligned component.

## Working with the `BitmapImage` Object

The `BitmapImage` object is the final rendered product from `canvas.render()`. It holds the pixel data and provides helpful methods.

```python
# Assuming 'image' is an Image object from the example above

# Save to a file (format is inferred from extension)
image.save("output.png")

# Get a Pillow Image object (requires `pip install Pillow`)
pil_image = image.to_pillow()
pil_image.show()

# Get a NumPy array for use with other libraries
numpy_array_bgra = image.to_numpy()
```

## Working with the `VectorImage` Object

The `VectorImage` object, returned by `canvas.render_as_svg()`, holds the SVG content as a string.

```python
vector_image = canvas.render_as_svg(user_banner)

# Save to a file
vector_image.save("output.svg")

# Get the raw SVG string
svg_string = vector_image.svg
```

## Canvas as a Style Template

The `Canvas` acts as a global style template. Properties you set on the Canvas are **inherited** by all elements unless explicitly overridden on individual builders.

**Inherited properties:**
- Typography: `font_family`, `font_size`, `font_weight`, `font_style`, `color`
- Text layout: `text_align`, `line_height`
- Text effects: `text_shadows`, `text_stroke`, `underline`, `strikethrough`

**Not inherited (element-specific):**
- Box model: `padding`, `margin`, `border`, `border_radius`
- Background: `background_color`, `background_image`
- Effects: `box_shadows`
- Layout: `size`, `position`, `flex_grow`, etc.

```python
from pictex import Canvas, Column, Text

# Canvas sets global typography
canvas = (
    Canvas()
    .font_family("Arial")
    .font_size(75)
    .color("blue")
)

# These inherit the font settings but can override them
layout = Column(
    Text("Inherits blue"),
    Text("Overrides to red").color("red"),
    Text("Inherits blue again")
)

canvas.render(layout).save("inheritance_example.png")
```
